<h2>What Makes Iraqi Bryani So Special ?</h2>
<strong>Rice-based: Usually long-grain rice like basmati is used.

Meat: Chicken, beef, or lamb, often cooked with a mix of aromatic spices.

Spices: Unlike Indian biryani, Iraqi biryani is less spicy but more aromatic. Common spices include cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, and black lime (loomi).

Nuts & raisins: Cashews or almonds and raisins are often added for a subtle sweetness.

Tomato sauce: Sometimes the meat is cooked in a light tomato-based sauce before mixing with rice.

Garnish: Fried onions, chopped parsley.</strong>


<h2>Cooking Style</h2>

<strong>The meat and rice are usually cooked separately.

Rice is often cooked with saffron or turmeric to give it a golden color.

After that, the meat is layered with the rice and allowed to steam together so the flavors meld and its usually served with salad and yogurt</strong>
